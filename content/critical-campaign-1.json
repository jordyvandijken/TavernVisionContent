After wiping out a grave threat to Emon’s emperor, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, the band of adventurers has been sent on a journey by Arcanist, Allura Vysoren to find Lady Kima of Vord, a Halfling Paladin of Bahamut, who was drawn to Kraghammer upon learning of a great evil resting beneath it. The party get their bearings in the sprawling, dwarven city, meet a few of its more colorful denizens, and learn that the dwarves have been dealing with unnatural creatures spilling out of the mines in recent months. The mine’s overseer, Nostoc Greyspine, barely finishes explaining their troubles, when a pack of goblins and ogres come spilling out of the mine’s entrance, pursued by something far worse.",

The team quickly gears up and makes their way into the mine, and begins a miles long trek down into the veins of Khaloor. After many hours wandering the dark, they reach a subterranean river within a massive, inky cavern where they are are attacked by a pair of umberhulks. The beasts are dispatched without too much difficulty, but in a fit of rage and shortsightedness, Grog charges toward a flickering light further off in the cavern. He stumbles across several Duergar, dark cousins of the dwarves above, as well as a skittering, four legged brain. The wretched thing is killed quickly, but not before lashing out at Grog’s psyche. The goliath’s mind is broken, and he falls to the ground in a heap.",

The Duergar only laughs at the barbarian's plight, and spits out warnings of the “master” that awaits them below, before Vax’ildan finally puts her out of her misery. After an uneasy night’s rest for the party and hours of meditation for Keylith, the druid is thankfully able to restore Grog’s mind, and the Vox Machina continue down through the great cavern. They pass through a gutted goblin village strewn with corpses, and eventually spy another group of Duergar, dragging along 3 dwarven captives. Scanlan and the twins whip out their flying carpet and tail the Duergar from afar, over a thin, creeking rope bridge. Scanlon disappears from sight, and now invisible, carefully makes his way into a war camp teeming with dark dwarves, ogres, and trolls. There he bears witness to an Illithid controlling all those around him, devouring the mind of one of the three dwarven miners.After catching his companions up, the group hatches a plan to lure their enemies into an illusion and drop them to their doom, into the cavern below the bridge. It is partially successful, but then, while acting as living bait, Vax’s mind is stunned by the Illithid and he is almost dropped to his death before Tiberius swoops in to save him. With the plan now in disarray, Vex and Keylith decide to delve into the chasm below the bridge, in spite of their companions’ protests. Their instincts serve them well though, and hidden behind a subterranean waterfall they find a cave. Within it awaits a powerful and unlikely ally.",

Now cut off from the Elder Brain, Clarota burns with hatred for this Kvarn, and wishes to free the Illithid race from the usurping entity. In order to do so, the Vox Machina must proceed further into the deep, and reach the center of Clarota’s hive. But in order for the heroes of Emon to reach the Illithid city in the belly of Khaloor, they must get past the first flayer they encountered, as well as its small army of Duergar. The heroes devise a plan, and fly themselves down to the center of the enemey’s war camp, to chance a risky assassination attempt on a creature that could easily break their will with a glance.",

Not quite fast enough, they are attacked mid flight and brought crashing to the ground, within a stone’s throw of the tunnel that will hopefully lead them to Lady Kima. With some quick spell work from Tiberius and Keylith, the group is able to flee further into the bowels of Khaloor and find shelter long enough to heal their wounds.

Covering more ground in the endless night of the Underdark, Vox Machina eventually reaches a massive cavern, spires of jagged obsidian stretching out for miles before them.

With a little dash of gnomic daring do, the group is able to sneak in through a secret entrance, and at long last find the one they have traveled so far to find: Lady Kima of Vord.​",

What Tiberius didn’t kill Vex’ahlia does. While the team tries to recover from the battle they are engaged by a Cloaker. After enveloping Tiberius and being telekinetically thrown from him the group chooses to retreat to the boat. The Cloaker gives chase and the party must battle over water. Scanlan proves his ingenuity once again and uses a new spell to help fight the Cloaker and once it is defeated Percy chooses to skin the monster. They make their way to another beach in the massive cavern and end up encountering a group of Grick. Tiberius makes short work of them by tossing a bomb crafted by Percy into the room and throwing a fireball on top of it. Once dealt with they look into the cavern room and discover the veil between planes that K’varn stepped through to gain entrance to Yag’voril. Keyleth chooses to scry Yag’voril and sees a collection of horrors being wrought by K’varn. With Keyleth’s scrying we learn that the dreaded K’varn is a massive Beholder. K’varn traps Keyleth within her scry and Vax’ildan saves her by slapping her face. They make their way closer to Yag’voril and they see a city made in a way that defies their understanding. As they travel closer to the end of their current goal they encounter a towering humanoid and as they try to react it rushes them.",

I was hired by some weirdo warlock tiefling named Snugglelord, and he hired some sailor Dwarf named Salty Pete. I like calling him Sam, though. Sam is a name I can get behind! Anyway, Snugglelord promised me riches unbound if I followed him in search of some mystical land called “chat room” so, I did it. For the money. Salty Pete kept harping about a ship he had from his sailing days, I’ll probably have to steal it and sell it later. The boat flipping market is HUGE! We get to this barren village that Snugglelord promised us would be bustling town. We find some people, but they ran away. Probably knew to step away from a boss fighter like me! We find out they were standing in front of a well, but we quickly found out that there wasn’t water in there, it was like some kinda evil juice! We find a house and burn it down. (Don’t be a snitch, though!) The person in the house led us to the leader of the town who tasked us to fix their evil juice problem. Salty falls down a pit for not letting the hero (me) investigate. I try to save him and am sucked in as well. Snugglelord follows. We see our lord and savior Bahamut and almost die. After falling through the other side, we see a gem. Snugglelord does something useful for once and finds out that the place is booby trapped. I use an ancient Dwarven rope technique to activate the trap and we fight this big ole golem. Oh yea, we accidentally cut off Salty Pete’s fingers, but he’s being totally cool about it. ​",

The airship touches down, and a representative from the Platinum Sanctuary escorts them, and the payload, through the chilled streets to the head of their order... High Bearer Vord himself. The task is laid before them: Enter the Hall of the Exalt, an ancient vault below the Sanctuary, exterminate the invading vermin, seal away the Reliquary containing the dreaded Horn of Orcus, and return safely. Easier said than done, as some of the Hall's defenses are active, and the party is forced to traverse a number of deadly traps in hopes of being rid of the evil artifact once and for all!",
